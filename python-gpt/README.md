In the realm of code, a concept profound,
Recursion dances, weaving cycles round.

Like a mirror reflecting its own reflection,
A function calls itself, a recursive connection.

A task is broken in steps so grand,
To solve it, the function takes your hand.

Each call delves deeper, like a maze,
Until a base case ends the phase.

With elegance, it traverses the unknown,
In a symphony of logic, all intricately honed.

So trust in recursion, its power sublime,
A loop within a loop, transcending time.
