Mini projects for getting familiar with different python libraries and APIs

## What

Each mini project is my attempt to do something basic with the library. Most times this is playing around and doing one small thing I find interesting.

## Why

I kept seeing tasks posted on Upwork that I didn't have confidence applying to because I lacked experience with the requisite libraries or APIs. So I wanted to do little mini projects to give me some experience and confidence to write proposals for tasks requiring that technoology.
