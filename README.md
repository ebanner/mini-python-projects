Mini projects for getting familiar with different python libraries and APIs

## Why?

I kept seeing tasks posted on Upwork that I didn't have confidence applying to because I lacked experience with the requisite libraries or APIs. So I wanted to do a little mini project to give me more confidence to write proposals for tasks requiring that technoology.
